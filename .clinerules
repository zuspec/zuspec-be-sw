# Bare-Metal C Code
.c files and the corresponding header files in src/include/zsp/be/sw/rt are 
bare-metal C code. These sources follow different conventions that standard
C code:

## Structural Inheritance

A struct inherits from another by listing the base struct 
first:

```c
typedef struct s1_s {
    int a;
} s1_t;

typedef struct s2_s { // s1_s : s2_s
    s2_t        base;
    int         b;
} s2_t;

#define s1(obj) ((s1_t *)(obj))
#define s2(obj) ((s2_t *)(obj))

s2_t v;

// Reference a base element via the <type>() macro
s1(&v)->a = 5;

```

# Python / PSS Unit Test Structure
tests/unit/test_generate_model.py provides a good example of Python/PSS unit test structure.
The multiline string at the top (pss_top) contains PSS (Portable Test and Stimulus) code. The rest of the function translates and executes that code. Note that import functions declared in the PSS code map to Python methods declared in the test.
