# Product Context

## Purpose
The Zuspec Backend Software (zuspec-be-sw) exists to enable execution of PSS (Portable Test and Stimulus Standard) models in software environments. It bridges the gap between PSS model specification and practical execution by providing a complete runtime implementation.

## Core Problems Solved

1. PSS Model Execution
   - Transforms abstract PSS models into executable C code
   - Provides runtime support for PSS semantics
   - Enables testing and validation of PSS models

2. Register Access
   - Implements efficient register block modeling
   - Provides mechanisms for register read/write operations
   - Supports hardware interface simulation

3. Concurrent Execution
   - Manages thread-based execution of PSS components
   - Handles actor lifecycle and scheduling
   - Coordinates async operations and scopes

4. Bare Metal Support
   - Enables PSS execution in resource-constrained environments
   - Provides lightweight runtime implementation
   - Supports embedded system testing

## User Experience Goals

1. Model Authors
   - Seamless translation of PSS models to executable code
   - Clear feedback on model execution
   - Intuitive debugging capabilities
   - Consistent runtime behavior

2. Test Engineers
   - Reliable test execution
   - Predictable scheduling behavior
   - Access to execution status and results
   - Integration with test frameworks

3. Integration Engineers
   - Clean API for system integration
   - Flexible deployment options
   - Clear documentation and examples
   - Extensible architecture

## Key Workflows

1. PSS Model Development
   ```
   [PSS Model] -> [Code Generation] -> [Runtime Execution] -> [Results]
   ```

2. Register Block Usage
   ```
   [Register Definition] -> [Block Generation] -> [Access Methods] -> [HW Interface]
   ```

3. Component Execution
   ```
   [Component Init] -> [Actor Creation] -> [Action Execution] -> [Completion]
   ```
