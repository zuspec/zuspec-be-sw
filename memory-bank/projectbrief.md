# Project Brief: Zuspec Backend Software (zuspec-be-sw)

## Overview
Zuspec Backend Software (zuspec-be-sw) is a critical component that provides software execution capabilities for PSS (Portable Test and Stimulus Standard) models. It serves as the backend implementation for executing PSS models in a software environment.

## Core Objectives
1. Implement a software backend for PSS model execution
2. Provide runtime support for PSS components and actions
3. Enable bare-metal C code generation and execution
4. Support register block modeling and access
5. Implement thread and actor management for PSS execution

## Key Components
1. Runtime Library
   - Bare-metal C implementation
   - Thread management
   - Component lifecycle management
   - Action execution
   - Memory management

2. Code Generation
   - C code generation for PSS models
   - Register block generation
   - Action and component structure generation
   - Execution block generation

3. Python Interface
   - API for model interaction
   - Scheduler implementation
   - Component and action type management

## Technical Requirements
1. Support for bare-metal execution
2. Efficient memory management
3. Thread-safe operation
4. Register block access capabilities
5. Support for async operations and scopes

## Project Scope
- Implementation of PSS v3.0 software execution semantics
- C code generation and runtime support
- Python API for model interaction
- Support for various execution environments
- Unit test framework integration

## Success Criteria
1. Successful execution of PSS models in software
2. Correct handling of register operations
3. Proper thread and actor management
4. Comprehensive unit test coverage
5. Integration with broader Zuspec ecosystem
